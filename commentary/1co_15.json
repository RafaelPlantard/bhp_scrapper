  "commentary": "The believers in Corinth were troubled about the nature of the resurrection of the dead. \u201cHow do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?\u201d (vs. 12). In other words, if Christ was not resurrected, then his death would have no meaning. The message about the state of the dead is clear: when a person dies in Christ they fall asleep until the resurrection of the righteous at the return of Christ.\nAs a missionary in Asia, I noted that death is one of the areas of greatest conflict in world views. As I prepared for the funeral of the young son of two of my colleagues at AIIAS, many young people asked me: what really happens when a person dies? Many other religions, such as Buddhist, Hindu, or even Roman Catholics, portray the souls of loved ones hovering around the dead body. Yet the message of the Bible is unequivocal: when a person dies, they sleep until Jesus comes again. Only Jesus has the power to give life again. Any other teachings are wrong, and believing that spirits hover of dead bodies is demonic.\nIn the end, \u201cThe last enemy that will be destroyed is death.\u201d\n",
