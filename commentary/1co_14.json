  "commentary": "It seems the one spiritual gift that has been abused the most is speaking in tongues. Paul devotes much of 1 Cor. 14 to correcting this abuse. The speaking in tongues that Paul is talking about here seems to be different from the one spoken of in Acts 2. Here in 1 Cor. 14, \u201che who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries\u201d (v. 2).\nIn Acts 2, the record says, \u201cAnd when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language.\u201d Acts 2:6 NKJV\nIn Paul\u2019s list of spiritual gifts, he makes speaking in tongues the last because that is where it belongs in terms of importance (see 1 Cor. 12 : 8 - 10, 28). As far as Paul is concerned, the gift to crave is the gift to prophesy (see 1 Cor. 14;1). This is because he \u201cwho speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church\u201d (v. 4). The gift of prophecy \u201cis the power to speak authoritatively for God, or on God\u2019s behalf, either by foretelling future events or by declaring God\u2019s will for the present.\u201d Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 771\n",
