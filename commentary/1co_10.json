  "commentary": "\"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God\" (1 Corinthians 10:31).\n\"It's just a ritual.\" \"It's only a symbol.\" \"Does God really care about what we eat?\"\nMaybe you've heard people express these popular views or said so yourself. Regardless, the idea that our thoughts and intentions matter more than our habits and actions is not true of our relationship with God. What we do with our bodies affects our spiritual life as much as our state of mind. As Paul explained, while we know that idols have no inherent power, if we eat a meal offered to idols, we affiliate ourselves with the demons who motivate false worship (10:19\u201321). Thus, symbolic acts have power because rituals are how humans relate to untouchable realities, including the spiritual world.\nWe do not unwittingly slip into the control of evil spirits, as if these symbols have power in themselves: Paul says not to ask whether food was offered to idols (10:25\u201327). Rather, it is willful displays of mixed loyalty to our community (10:28) and the spiritual world (10:25) that compromise our integrity.\nFinally, rituals like Sabbath-keeping and the Lord's supper, as well as abstaining from alcohol and unclean meats, send a message to ourselves. They are habitual reminders that we are living for an unseen dawn that is arriving soon\u2014reminders that everything we do with our bodies is to be directed toward the light of His soon-coming kingdom.\n",
