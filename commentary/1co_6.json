  "commentary": "When through the lenses of the love of Jesus we witness our brother considering a damaging choice, it is our duty as saints to lovingly offer our guidance. God has declared that the unjustified do not have the same caliber of discernment which we have been gifted, and therefore the burden of judgement (i.e. to carefully guide someone to truth) falls with us.\nThe instructions are clear: 1.Do not take disagreements between brothers and sisters to a counsel of unbelievers. 2.We must care for our bodies in such a way that they will not be polluted.\nWe all must aspire to the perfected character of God, though the promise given for this battle with self is great! God has promised that what we desire and earnestly ask for in His name, He will deliver (Matthew 7:7)! So do not be afraid to ask for the fruits of the Holy Spirit. Then lay all temptation at the feet of Jesus and He will liberate you to lead others to the same light.\nBut remember, the log in our own eye may require rebuke in the same measure in which we rebuke another\u2019s speck (Matthew 7:5).\n",
