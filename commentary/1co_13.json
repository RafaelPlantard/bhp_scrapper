  "commentary": "It is important to know the type of love Paul is talking about in 1 Corinthians 13. The ancient Greek had four words for love: 1.) Eros \u2014 this refers to romantic love. 2.) Storge \u2014 this describes family love, i.e. the love between a parent and a child. 3.) Philia \u2014 Brotherly friendship and affection. It is the love between friends. All three types of love are innate to human nature. Thus you do not have to be a child of God to have them. Even publicans have philia love (see Matthew 5:46).\nThe fourth type of love, Agape, is not innate to human nature. It comes only from God . This is a self-sacrificing love. It is not an emotion but a principle that guides us to choose kindness towards everyone, including the unlovable. This is the love Paul is talking about in this chapter. Driven by this love, Jesus and Stephen prayed for those who persecuted them (see Luke 23:34; Acts 7:60). To be acceptable to God, our deeds must be driven by Agape love (see 2 Corinthians 5:14).\n",
