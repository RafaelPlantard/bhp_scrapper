  "commentary": "Apparently, there were some misunderstandings, rivalry and even abuse within the Corinthian church between possessors of various gifts. Gifts were given after the ascension to bring the church into unity and to fit the people of God for service and character development. However, some believed their gifts were superior in importance. Paul emphasized that all gifts are produced by the same Spirit. All have the same origin and purpose, and none are to be despised or belittled. Recognition ought to be given to the one who dispenses these powers and not the recipient.\nThere are different kinds of service in church but one Lord, the same God. One gift is prophecy; Ellen White had this gift. Her writings will benefit the church until the end of time.\nAnother gift is discerning spirits--the ability to recognize divine and counterfeit inspiration. All should be on the alert to identify and reject false teachers. Satan is ready to counterfeit the true and support false claims of pretenders by supernatural miracles.\nAs a member of God\u2019s church, you have the assurance that the Holy Spirit will equip you to use your gifts with effectiveness.\nThe ultimate objective of the Spirit\u2019s gifts is to prepare the church to meet God without spot or wrinkle. So, whatever your gifts are, remember to use them to help finish the work.*\n",
