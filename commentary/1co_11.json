  "commentary": "As Paul speaks to the issues of head coverings and the Lord's Supper, he reminds the Corinthians that all proper behavior must point back to Jesus Christ. How we worship brings honor or dishonor to God.\nIn the sexually charged environment of Corinth, a woman who did not cover her head was the same as a prostitute. In the context of the ancient world, Paul argues that a married woman ought to keep her head covered. This text has been interpreted many different ways throughout Christian history. Early Seventh-day Adventist pioneers argued for principles, instead of the idea that that all women should come to church with their head covered. Similarly, early leaders such as James White, objected to the idea that women should not speak in public (see his comment in Spiritual Gifts , vol. 3, pg. 24).\nPaul reminds us that the emblems of the Lord's Supper are sacred, representing the broken body and spilled blood of Jesus Christ on the cross. The ordinance affirms Christ\u2019s sacrificial atonement, and affirms our belief in the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. No wonder James White observed that the Lord\u2019s Supper should be called the \u201cAdvent ordinance.\u201d\n",
