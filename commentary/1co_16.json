  "commentary": "The brethren in Jerusalem need financial support; therefore, Paul organizes a fundraising program for them from the churches in the Gentile world. As he ends his first letter to the Corinthians, he writes:\n\u201cNow concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so you must do also: On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up as he may prosper, that there be no collections when I come\u201d (1 Cor. 16 : 1, 2 NKJV).\nWait a minute? Was the church in Corinth meeting on Sunday, the first day of the week, for worship? No! \u201cThe Jews did not handle money on the Sabbath, especially during worship. Paul\u2019s counsel demonstrates that the early Gentile and Jewish Christians worshipped together on the Sabbath.\u201d\u2014 Andrews Study Bible, p. 1513. When Paul writes that \u201cOn the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside,\u201d he was promoting a systematic giving whereby each person would lay money aside privately at home each Sunday.\nTherefore, Christians who claim this text supports Sunday observance have misunderstood its intended meaning.\n",
