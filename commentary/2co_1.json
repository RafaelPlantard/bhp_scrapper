  "commentary": "Paul begins with the comforting words that God will be with the Corinthian congregation in the midst of their troubles (1:3-11). These words remain relevant to us.Today we seek \u201ccomfort through Christ in the same way that we share so many of Christ\u2019s sufferings\u201d (vs. 5, CEB). As fellow believers we have the opportunity to recognize those around us who \u201care partners in suffering\u201d as well as \u201cpartners in comfort\u201d (vs. 7).\nIf we are honest we all recognize that there are times, when like the Apostle Paul, we do not think we will survive (vs. 8). Yet we are a people of hope because it is Jesus Christ who rescues us from a more \u201cterrible death,\u201d the alienation with God brought about by sin. This rescue was made possible through the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. In the meantime, Paul says, we are grateful for the many prayers for our ministry and suffering, and for the precious gift of salvation through Jesus Christ (vs. 11). Prayer does not prevent suffering, but rather, it gives us strength to endure it.\n",
