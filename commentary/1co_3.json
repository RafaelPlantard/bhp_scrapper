  "commentary": "A church that is divided is like a poison. Such divisions are indicative of the \u201ccarnal\u201d human nature, instead of the Spirit of God (vs.1-4). Ellen White warned about such a situation during her lifetime. A spirit of criticism, she admonishes, causes great injury within the church. What is worse is that extremist thinking prevents the truth from reaching other people. Above all else Adventists must not be a conscience for another ( Historical Sketches , 211-212).\n\u201cHe who is guilty of wrong,\u201d she also warned, \u201cis the first to suspect wrong. By condemning another he is trying to conceal or excuse the evil of his own heart. It was through sin that men gained the knowledge of evil; no sooner had the first pair sinned than they began to accuse each other; and this is what human nature will inevitably do when uncontrolled by the grace of Christ\u201d ( Thoughts from the Mount of Blessings , 126).\nIn conclusion, Paul uses the metaphor of a \u201cbuilding\u201d (vs. 9-10). What matters most is that \u201cno other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\u201d\n",
