  "commentary": "The Corinthians were faced with a dilemma. Most of the meat in the markets had been offered to idols. Should the Christian buy it and eat it, or leave it alone?\nAccording to Paul the answer should not be based on head knowledge alone. He agrees that there is no reality to idols and therefore the sacrifice does not change the meat in any way. However, there were members in the church for whom eating meat offered to idols was part of pagan worship before they became Christians. For this group, the practice was seen as a denial of Christ since it implied participation in the worship of an idol. Consequently, Paul was concerned that those who choose to eat the meat might give the impression that it was ok to worship both God and idols, and in doing so, they could be responsible for causing others to sin.\nWhile we may not face the same dilemma, the decisions we make should balance our knowledge with a love and concern for others. Do you take time to consider how your choices might be understood by onlookers? Will your choices uplift others in their faith or cause them to stumble?\n",
